# FE for Symfony API (Task management)

Things that could be improved if given more time:
 + Use useEffect hook to get data from the server rather than using the dummy items data
 + Add an isLoading (true/false) feature (spinner to improve UX)
 + Make use of taskService (which will use apiClient to make http request to Symfony backend)
 + Add update validation rules on form creation
